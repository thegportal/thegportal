<div class="qass">
This is a very interesting question & I'm not quite sure how it occurs. One reason might be that I use the <p class="ht">&lt;embed&gt;</p> & <p class="ht">&lt;object&gt;</p> tags instead of the <p class="ht">&lt;iframe&gt;</p> tag to embed my games, which could cause a bug in Securly. :)

<div class="qass">
I can't add Fortnite because to do that, I would need to add proxies so that you could access cloud gaming to play Fortnite. Proxies are unblocked browsers & my school is worried that kids will search up inappropriate content on them becuase they can't block anything that's on proxies. If I add proxies I could get suspended, expelled, or even get a juvenile referral. That's why I can't add Fortnite. :)
